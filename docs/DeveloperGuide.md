### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/vms/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/vms/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/vms/ui/Ui.java)

The `UI` is responsible for the GUI of VMS. It does so with the aid of JavaFX UI framework. To simplify the creation of GUI layouts of different parts, several classes extends `UiPart` which is responsible for the creation of JavaFX scene graph structures through `.fxml` files. The `.fxml` files of these UI parts are stored in `src/main/resources/view` in with matching names to the class using them. For example, the `.fxml` file of [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/vms/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **NOTE**: Not all UI classes responsible for displaying something graphically extends `UiPart`. `UiPart` is used as a tool to simplify the creation of complicated GUI layout. Simple GUI parts such as `DetailedView` and `ListViewPanel` do not extend `UiPart`.
</div>

Below shows a (partial) class diagram of the main parts of `Ui` component.

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **NOTE**: `UiPart` has been omitted as the purpose of this diagram is to show the structure between the main parts of the `UI` component.
</div>

As seen from the class diagram above, `MainWindow` has composition type relationship with several other classes. Namely,

* `DetailedView` - responsible for the graphical display of the **detail panels**.
  * 1 each for patients and vaccinations.
* `CommandBox` - responsible for gathering the user's command input.
* `HelpWindow` - responsible for the graphical display of the help window.
* `ListViewPanel` - responsible for the graphical display of the **list view panels**.
  * 1 each for patients, vaccinations and appointments
* `ResultDisplay` - responsible for displaying messages to the user.

The classes mentioned above are only initialized when `fillInnerParts()` method of `MainWindow` is called. The object diagram below show the state of `MainWindow` after `fillInnerParts()` has been called.

![State of MainWindow](images/UiObjectDiagram.png)

##### `DetailedView`

To display its contents, `DetailedView` uses an observer pattern to observe for the data that it needs to display. It observes an `ObjectProperty` through a `ChangeListener`, both of which are defined by JavaFX. To convert the observed object to the `Node` object that JavaFX can display, `DetailedView` will also have a `Function`, that is provided on construction, which will do exactly this. Below shows the class diagram and notice how that there are no external dependencies to other parts of VMS.

![Class diagram of DetailedView](images/UiDetailedViewClassDiagram.png)

![Object diagram of DetailedView](images/UiDetailedViewPatientObjectDiagram.png)

![Activity diagram of DetailedView](images/UiDetailedViewRefreshActivityDiagram.png)

##### `ListViewPanel`

Similar to `DetailedView`, `ListViewPanel` also uses an observer pattern and a `Function` to convert the observed object to a `Node`. However, it observes an `ObservableMap` through a `MapChangeListener`, both of which also defined by JavaFX. Only the values of the observed map will be displayed and the `Function` of `ListViewPanel` is used to convert these values to their equivalent `Node` representations. The order in which the values of the observed map are displayed is defined by a `Comparator` by default is the comparator produced from `Comparator.naturalOrder()`. Below shows the class diagram of `ListViewPanel`.

![Object diagram of Appointment ListViewPanel](images/UiListViewPanelApptObjectDiagram.png)

![Activity diagram of ListViewPanel](images/UiListViewPanelActivityDiagram.png)

##### `ResultDisplay`

To display messages to the user after every command that the user has inputted, a `Consumer`, that accepts a list of `CommandMessage`, is used to update `ResultDisplay` whenever `Logic` has completed the execution of a command regardless if it was successful. The `Consumer` only function is to call the `displayMessage(List<CommandMessage>)` method of `ResultDisplay`. This method will convert all `CommandMessage` to their equivalent `Node` representation, via `ResultMessageBox`, allowing `CommandMessage` to be graphically displayed. To understand more about when this `Consumer` is called within `Logic`, read [here](#executing-a-command). Below shows the class and activity diagram for better visualization of the structure of `ResultDisplay` and the activities taking place when `displayMessage(List<CommandMessage>)` is called respectively.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/vms/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" />

`LogicManager` is a concrete implementation of `Logic` which handles the logical components of VMS. Its main responsibility is to handle the execution of user entered commands.

`LogicManager` handles command execution in the form of an execution queue. When the user enters a command, that command is queued into an execution queue in `LogicManager`. Both queueing and the execution of commands can happen in parallel. However, at any one time, at most one command will be executed at a time.

#### Command execution

For the entire command execution portion of the `Logic` component, only `queue(String)` method is exposed to the outside. As such, to queue and execute a user command, only the `queue(String)` method of `Logic` will have to be called. This method will queue the command for execution and execute it when it is its turn. Command inputs are stored and queued in an internal queue called the command queue (`cmdQueue`). To allow for parallel queuing and dequeuing, this queue has a type of `LinkedBlockingDeque`. The elements stored within the queue are the `String` of the command input that the user has entered.

To avoid dependencies with other classes, specifically UI related classes, `ModelManager` stores a `completionHandler`, which is a `Consumer<List<CommandMessage>>`. `completionHandler` can be set and changed by other classes and is called whenever a command execution is completed.

##### Queuing a command

When the `queue(String)` is called upon, the following happens.

1. The command input is added to the end of `cmdQueue`.
2. An attempt is then made to start the execute the next command in the queue through `startNext()`. This is described in detail in the next section.

<img src="images/LogicQueueSequenceDiagram.png" id="logic-queue-sequence-diagram-fig">

##### Starting a command

The method `startNext()` is a private method in `LogicManager` that handles the starting of the execution of a command. When it is called upon, a check is done to check if there are any command still in execution and that there are still commands yet to be executed in `cmdQueue`. If this is not the case, nothing happens and the method returns silently. If not, the following happens.

1. The next command input in `cmdQueue` is polled.
2. A new `Thread` object is created whose task is to parse and execute the command input polled in step 1.
3. The created `Thread` objects is then started on a separate thread to perform its task of executing the command.

<img src="images/StartNextCommandSequenceDiagram.png" id="logic-start-next-command-fig">

##### Executing a command

When the created `Thread` in `startNext()` is started, Java Virtual Machine will call its `run()` method at an appropriate time. This will start the parsing then execution of a command input by calling the `processCommand(String)` of `LogicManager`. The following sequence describes how a command input is executed when `processCommand(String)` is called.

1. The command input is passed to the stored instance of `Model` in `LogicManager` to be parsed. The returned result is a `ParseResult` which is an association class of the parsed `Command` and its corresponding `CommandMessage` if there are warnings while parsing. More accurately, the parsed `Command` is one of the concrete implementations of `Command`.
2. The `Command` in the returned `ParseResult` object of step 1 is then executed. It is given the stored instance of `Model` to perform its task and its interaction with model depends on the concrete implementation of `Command` parsed. This is represented as a **ref** frame in the sequence diagram below to highlight that the `Command` object and `Model` interacts with each other, but their interactions may vary depending on the implementation of the parsed `Command`. Once done it returns a `CommandMessage`.
3. The new state of `Model` is then saved into hard disk through `saveModel()` method. This will return a list of `CommandMessage` containing the error messages that occurred while saving.
4. All `CommandMessage`s that have been created from steps 1 to 3 are combined as a list and passed to `completeExecution(List<String>)` method.
5. The `completionHandler` is then passed the combined list of `CommandMessage` in step 5 to handle the completion of the command.
6. An attempt is then made to start the next command through `startNext()` as described in the section before.

<img src="images/LogicCommandExecutionSequenceDiagram.png" id="logic-command-execution-sequence-diagram">

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **INFO**: The parsing of commands are handled in `Model` to allow for user custom keywords.
</div>

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/vms/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The responsibilities of `Model` component,

* stores the runtime state of the other managers:
  * `PatientManager`
  * `VaxTypeManager`
  * `AppointmentManager`
  * `KeywordManager`
* stores the objects to be displayed as a separate filtered map which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableMap<K, V>` where `V` is the type of object being stored (eg. `IdData<Patient>`) and `K` is the type of the key the stored object is mapped to (for `Patient` and `Appointment`, this is an `Integer` and as for `VaxType`, this is a `String`).
* stores the object to be detailed as a `ObjectProperty<V>` where `V` is the type of the object to be displayed (eg. `IdData<Patient>`).
* store a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.

### Patient component

**API** : [`Patient.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/vms/model/patient/Patient.java)

To represent a patient, `Patient` contains the Identity and Medical information using the following attributes:

* Identity:
  * The `name` of the patient
  * The `phone` of the patient
  * The `dateOfBirth` of the patient
* Medical:
  * The `bloodType` of the patient
  * The `allergies` of the patient
  * The `vaccines` of the patient

`Patient` have limitations on its attributes according to the [Non-Functional Requirements](#non-functional-requirements).

#### PatientManager

On top of storing `Patient` objects, `PatientManager` ensures the patient's vaccination records are updated if the name of a vaccination changes. It also ensures that there is a maximum limit of `Patient` objects allowed to be stored according to the [Non-Functional Requirements](#non-functional-requirements).

### Vaccination component

Vaccinations are represented as `VaxType` objects and stored within `VaxTypeManager`.

#### VaxType

To represent a vaccination, `VaxType` contains the following attributes:

* A name represented as a `GroupName` object.
* A set of groups which the vaccination classifies under as a set of `GroupName` objects.
* A minimum age as an `Age` object.
* A maximum age as an `Age` object.
* A set ingredients of the vaccination as a set of `GroupName` objects.
* A list of requirements of vaccination groups that will have to be taken before this vaccination can be taken as a list of `Requirement` objects.

#### VaxTypeManager

On top of storing `VaxType` objects, `VaxTypeManager` ensures the uniqueness of `VaxType`. It also ensures that there is a maximum limit of `VaxType` objects allowed to be stored according to the [Non-Functional Requirements](#non-functional-requirements).

### Appointment component

**API** : [`Appointment.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/vms/model/appointment/Appointment.java)

The `Appointment` component,

* Contains the details of patients' appointment
  * The patients' `Patient id`
  * The duration of each appointment (Uses the `start time` and `end time`)
  * The type and dose of `vaccine` to be administered
  * The `status` of the appointment

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/vms/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component is responsible for the reading and writing of the states of the different managers in `Model` to and from the hard disk. As shown in the diagram above, it inherits from `PatientManagerStorage`, `UserPrefsStorage`, `VaxTypeStorage`, `AppointmentStorage` and `KeywordStorage`. As such, it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).

### Keyword component

<!-- TODO -->

#### Cascading delete

The cascading delete feature is an important part of the VMS's design, as it helps to maintain data integrity and avoid orphaned records in the system. When a object is deleted from the VMS, any related records should also be deleted to ensure that the system remains consistent.

##### Relationship between `Patient` and `Appointment`

When a `Patient` record is deleted from the system, any associated `Appointment` records will be deleted as well. This is because `Appointment` records are directly linked to a specific `Patient`, and it would not make sense to keep these records around if the `Patient` is no longer in the system. The implementation can be found in [`AppointmentManager.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/vms/model/appointment/AppointmentManager.java).

##### Relationship between `VaxType` and `Appointment`

When a `VaxType` record is deleted from the system, any associated `Appointment` records will be deleted as well. This is because `VaxType` records are directly linked to a specific `Appointment`, and it would not make sense to keep these records around if the `VaxType` record is no longer offered by the VaxType center. The implementation can be found in [`AppointmentManager.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/vms/model/appointment/AppointmentManager.java).

##### Relationship between `Patient` and `VaxType`

On the other hand, `Patient` records are not deleted when a `VaxType` record is deleted from the system. This is because `Patient` records should not be modified if a `VaxType` is no longer offered. If a `VaxType` record is deleted, the associated `Appointment` records will be deleted, but any `Patient` records associated with those `VaxType` records will not be updated in the system. This is because the `Patient` records may still be relevant, even if the `VaxType` is no longer in the system.

#### Cascading Change

The cascading change feature is an important part of the VMS's design, as it helps to maintain data integrity and avoid orphaned records in the system. When a object is changed in the VMS, any related records should also be changed to ensure that the system remains consistent.

##### Relationship between `Patient` and `Appointment`

When a `Patient` record is updated in the system, any associated `Appointment` records will be updated as well. This is because `Appointment` records are directly linked to a specific `Patient`, and if the patient's information changes, it is important to update any related `appointment`s to reflect this change. The implementation can be found in [`AppointmentManager.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/vms/model/appointment/AppointmentManager.java).

##### Relationship between `VaxType` and `Patient`

When a `VaxType` record is updated in the system, any associated `Patient` records will be updated as well. This is because `VaxType` records contain information about the `VaxType`s that a `patient` has taken, and if the `VaxType` information changes, it is important to update any related `patient` records to reflect this change. The implementation can be found in [`PatientManager.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/vms/model/patient/PatientManager.java).

##### Relationship between `VaxType` and `Appointment`

Additionally, when a `VaxType` record is updated in the system, any associated `Appointment` records will be updated as well. This is because `VaxType` records are directly linked to a specific `Appointment`, and if the `VaxType` information changes, it is important to update any related `appointment` records to reflect this change. The implementation can be found in [`AppointmentManager.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/vms/model/appointment/AppointmentManager.java).

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.vms.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Patient

#### Adding a Patient

The **Adding a Patient** mechanism is facilitated by `VMS`. The Patient created is stored inside `PatientManager` object.

##### Execution Sequence

Given below is an example usage scenario when a user enter `patient add --n John Doe --p 98765432 --d 2001-03-19 --b B+ --a catfur --a pollen --v covax` as a command.

1. The user enters the command in the `UI component`
2. It will be passed to the `Logic component`
3. When `AddCommandParser` receives the information from `PatientParser`, it will invoke the following methods to help with the parsing.
    1. `ParserUtil#parseName` will be called to create a Name object using "John Doe".
    2. `ParserUtil#parsePhone` will be called to create a Phone object using "98765432".
    3. `ParserUtil#parseDob` will be called to create a Dob object using "2001-03-19".
    4. `ParserUtil#parseBloodType` will be called to create a BloodType object using "B+".
    5. `ParserUtil#parseGroups` will be called to create GroupName[] object named allergies using ["catfur", "pollen"].
    6. `ParserUtil#parseGroups` will be called to create GroupName[] object named vaccines using ["covax"].
4. After successfully parsing the args, `AddCommandParser` will create a Patient using the new Name, Phone, Dob, BloodType, Allergies<GroupName>, Vaccines<GroupName>. Then it will create an `AddCommand` with the new Patient object.
5. When `AddCommand#execute` is called, `model#addPatient` will be called to add the new Patient into the model. `AddCommand` will then return `CommandMessage` to indicate it's success.

Note that `Allergies` and `Vaccines` are optional, so the user does not need to include `--a ` or `--v` if the it is not applicable.

The activity diagram below illustrates the workflow of patient `AddCommand` that is described above.

<img src="images/patient/AddPatientActivityDiagram.png" width="550" />

Given below is an sequence diagram that illustrates the **Adding a Patient** mechanism behaves at every step.

<img src="images/patient/AddPatientSequenceDiagram.png" width="550" />

#### Listing Patients

The **Listing Patients** mechanism is facilitated by `VMS`. It will list all the Patients that are stored in the `PatientManager`.

##### Execution Sequence

Given below is an example usage scenario when a user enter `patient list` as a command.

1. The user enters the command in the `UI component`
2. It will be passed to the `Logic component`
3. `PatientParser` will invoke `ListCommandParser`, which will create `ListCommand` directly as they do not use any args.
4. When `ListCommand#execute` is called, `model#updateFilteredPatientList` will be called to update the list with the `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PATIENTS` to display all Patients.

The activity diagram below illustrates the workflow of patient `ListCommand` that is described above.

<img src="images/patient/ListPatientsActivityDiagram.png" width="550" />

Given below is an sequence diagram that illustrates the **Listing Patients** mechanism behaves at every step.

<img src="images/patient/ListPatientsSequenceDiagram.png" width="550" />

#### Finding a Patient

The **Finding a Patient** mechanism is facilitated by `VMS`. It will find specific list of Patient objects from `PatientManager` inside `VMS` object with the keywords provided.

The user can choose to add flags when searching, to search for the specific attributes of a Patient. If no flags are present, the mechanism will assume that it is searching the Patient's name.

##### Execution Sequence

Given below is an example usage scenario when a user enter `patient find --n John Deer --p 98765431 --d 2001-03-19 --b B+ --a catfur --v covax` as a command.

1. The user enters the command in the `UI component`
2. It will be passed to the `Logic component`
3. When `FindCommandParser` receives the information from `PatientParser`, it will invoke the following methods to help with the parsing. It will throw a `ParseException` if there are no args present.
    1. `ParserUtil#parseName` will be called to create a Name object using "John Doe".
    2. `ParserUtil#parsePhone` will be called to create a Phone object using "98765432".
    3. `ParserUtil#parseDob` will be called to create a Dob object using "2001-03-19".
    4. `ParserUtil#parseBloodType` will be called to create a BloodType object using "B+".
    5. `ParserUtil#parseGroups` will be called to create GroupName[] object named allergies using ["catfur", "pollen"].
    6. `ParserUtil#parseGroups` will be called to create GroupName[] object named vaccines using ["covax"].
4. After successfully parsing the args, the following will happen
    1. `FindCommandParser` will create an FindPatientDescriptor using the new Name, Phone, Dob, BloodType, Allergies `<GroupName>`, Vaccines `<GroupName>`.
    1a. If none of the flags are present, it will take the entire arg as a `setNameSearch`.
    2. Then it will create an `FindCommand` with the new FindPatientDescriptor object.
5. When `FindCommand#execute` is called, the following will happen.
    1. It will check if the different attributes of FindPatientDescriptor is present.
    2. It will find the patient by creating different `Optional<AttributePredicate>`.
    3. The different predicates will be added into a `List<Predicate<Patient>>` and passed to `model#setPatientFilters` to display the filtered Patients.
    4. `FindCommand` will then return `CommandMessage` to indicate it's success and the number of patients found.

The activity diagram below illustrates the workflow of patient `FindCommand` that is described above.

<img src="images/patient/FindPatientActivityDiagram.png" width="550" />

Given below is an sequence diagram that illustrates the **Finding a Patient** mechanism behaves at every step.

<img src="images/patient/FindPatientSequenceDiagram.png" width="550" />

`FindCommandParser#parse` will call `String#trim` to trim the search request. If there is no additional flags, it will fall back to the default of using the search term to find Names.

#### Editing a Patient

The **Editing a Patient** mechanism is facilitated by `VMS`. It will read and modify a target Patient object from `PatientManger` inside `VMS` object.

##### Execution Sequence

Given below is an example usage scenario when a user enter `patient edit 5 --n John Deer --p 98765431 --d 2001-03-19 --b B+ --a catfur --a pollen --v covax` as a command.

1. The user enters the command in the `UI component`
2. It will be passed to the `Logic component`
3. When `EditCommandParser` receives the information from `PatientParser`, it will invoke the following methods to help with the parsing. It will short circuit and throw a `ParseException` if 1. is not fulfilled.
    1. `ParserUtil#parseIndex` will be called to create a Index object using "5".
    2. `ParserUtil#parseName` will be called to create a Name object using "John Doe".
    3. `ParserUtil#parsePhone` will be called to create a Phone object using "98765432".
    4. `ParserUtil#parseDob` will be called to create a Dob object using "2001-03-19".
    5. `ParserUtil#parseBloodType` will be called to create a BloodType object using "B+".
    6. `ParserUtil#parseGroups` will be called to create GroupName[] object named allergies using ["catfur", "pollen"].
    7. `ParserUtil#parseGroups` will be called to create GroupName[] object named vaccines using ["covax"].
4. After successfully parsing the args, `EditCommandParser` will create an editPatientDescriptor using the new Name, Phone, Dob, BloodType, Allergies `<GroupName>`, Vaccines `<GroupName>`. Then it will create an `EditCommand` with the new editPatientDescriptor object with the index.
5. When `EditCommand#execute` is called, the following will happen.
    1. It will ensure that the Index given is within the list, else it will throw a CommandException
    2. It will edit the patient by creating a new patient with the new values from the Parser as Patients are Immutable
    3. Then `model#setPatient` will be called to add the new Patient into the model.
    4. `EditCommand` will then return `CommandMessage` to indicate it's success.

The activity diagram below illustrates the workflow of patient `EditCommand` that is described above.

<img src="images/patient/EditPatientActivityDiagram.png" width="550" />

Given below is an example usage scenario and how **Editing a Patient** mechanism behaves at each step.

<img src="images/patient/EditPatientSequenceDiagram.png" width="550" />

#### Deleting a Patient

The **Deleting a Patients** mechanism is facilitated by `VMS`. It will delete specific Patient objects from `PatientManager` inside `VMS` object with using the index provided.

##### Execution Sequence

Given below is an example usage scenario when a user enter `patient delete 5` as a command.

#### Clearing Patients

The **Clearing Patients** mechanism is facilitated by `VMS`. It will set the patient manager with a new empty patient manager, effectively clearing all the Patients

##### Execution Sequence

Given below is an example usage scenario when a user enter `patient clear` as a command.

1. The user enters the command in the `UI component`
2. It will be passed to the `Logic component`
3. `PatientParser` will invoke `ClearCommand` which will create `ClearCommand` as they do not use any args.
4. When `ClearCommand#execute` is called, `model#setPatientManager` will be called to update the list a new PatientManger() with no patients.

The activity diagram below illustrates the workflow of patient `ClearCommand` that is described above.

<!-- ### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedVms`. It extends `Vms` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `patientManagerStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedVms#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current patient manager state in its history.
* `VersionedVms#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous patient manager state from its history.
* `VersionedVms#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone patient manager state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitVms()`, `Model#undoVms()` and `Model#redoVms()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedVms` will be initialized with the initial patient manager state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single patient manager state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th patient in the patient manager. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitVms()`, causing the modified state of the patient manager after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `patientManagerStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted patient manager state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new patient. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitVms()`, causing another modified patient manager state to be saved into the `patientManagerStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitVms()`, so the patient manager state will not be saved into the `patientManagerStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the patient was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoVms()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous patient manager state, and restores the patient manager to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial Vms state, then there are no previous Vms states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoVms()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoVms()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the patient manager to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `patientManagerStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest patient manager state, then there are no undone Vms states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoVms()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the patient manager, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitVms()`, `Model#undoVms()` or `Model#redoVms()`. Thus, the `patientManagerStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitVms()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `patientManagerStateList`, all patient manager states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behaviour that most modern desktop applications follow.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire patient manager.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the patient being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
