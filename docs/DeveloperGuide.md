### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/vms/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/vms/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/vms/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PatientListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/vms/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Patient` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/vms/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component execution queue works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to queue a user command, it queues that user command into an internal queue in `LogicManager`.
2. `LogicManager` continues to parse and execute any previously queued command inputs until the queued command input in step 1 is next.
3. The next user command is polled from the queue and parsed using `VmsParser` to produce a `ParseResult`.
4. The `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses eg. `AddCommand`), within the resultant `ParseResult`, is executed.
5. During execution, the `Command` object communicates with `Model` to perform its task. When it is done, it produces a `CommandMessage`.
6. `LogicManager` combines the `CommandMessage` within `ParseResult` in 3 and the resultant `CommandMessage` in 5 into a list and passes it to its set `Consumer` to handle these `CommandMessages`. See [IU component](#ui-component) on this is handled.
7. If the command executed has follow up commands, a new `ParseResult` is created that encapsulates the follow up command and an empty `CommandMessage`. This `ParseResult` is sent to be executed and the process starts from 4.
8. Else, the execution for this user command ends and `LogicManager` executes the next user command in its internal queue if present, continuing from 3.
9. If there are no user commands waiting to be executed, `Logic` waits for a user command to be queued and the cycle repeats from 1.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

1. When called upon to parse a user command, `VmsParser` a `FeatureParser` or more specifically, one of its subclasses (eg `BasicParser`, `PatientParser`, etc) depending on the user command. Used input from the user command are removed.
2. The `FeatureParser` in 1 then parses the remaining user command to create a `CommandParser`. Similar to 1, the created `CommandParser` is more specifically one of its subclasses (eg. `AddCommandParser`) and used inputs from the user command are removed.
3. The resultant `CommandParser` parses the remaining user input to create a `Command` object, such as `AddCommand`, and optionally a `CommandMessage`. Both of which are encapsulated into a `ParseResult` and returned.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/vms/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The responsibilities of `Model` component,

* stores the runtime state of the other managers:
  * `PatientManager`
  * `VaxTypeManager`
  * `AppointmentManager`
  * `KeywordManager`
* stores the objects to be displayed as a separate filtered map which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableMap<K, V>` where `V` is the type of object being stored (eg. `IdData<Patient>`) and `K` is the type of the key the stored object is mapped to (for `Patient` and `Appointment`, this is an `Integer` and as for `VaxType`, this is a `String`).
* stores the object to be detailed as a `ObjectProperty<V>` where `V` is the type of the object to be displayed (eg. `IdData<Patient>`).
* store a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.

### Patient component

<!-- TODO -->

### Vaccination component

Vaccinations are represented as `VaxType` objects and stored within `VaxTypeManager`.

#### VaxType

To represent a vaccination, `VaxType` contains the following attributes:

* A name represented as a `GroupName` object.
* A set of groups which the vaccination classifies under as a set of `GroupName` objects.
* A minimum age as an `Age` object.
* A maximum age as an `Age` object.
* A set ingredients of the vaccination as a set of `GroupName` objects.
* A list of requirements of vaccination groups that will have to be taken before this vaccination can be taken as a list of `Requirement` objects.

#### VaxTypeManager

On top of storing `VaxType` objects, `VaxTypeManager` ensures the uniqueness of `VaxType`. It also ensures that there are at most 30 `VaxType` objects stored.

### Appointment component

**API** : [`Appointment.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/vms/model/appointment/Appointment.java)

The `Appointment` component,

* Contains the details of patients' appointment
  * The patients' `Patient id`
  * The duration of each appointment (Uses the `start time` and `end time`)
  * The type and dose of `vaccine` to be administered
  * The `status` of the appointment

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/vms/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component is responsible for the reading and writing of the states of the different managers in `Model` to and from the hard disk. As shown in the diagram above, it inherits from `PatientManagerStorage`, `UserPrefsStorage`, `VaxTypeStorage`, `AppointmentStorage` and `KeywordStorage`. As such, it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).

### Keyword component

<!-- TODO -->

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.vms.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Adding a Patient

The **Adding a Patient** mechanism is facilitated by `VMS`. The Patient created is stored inside `PatientManager` object.

##### Execution Sequence

Given below is an example usage scenario when a user enter `patient add --n John Doe --p 98765432 --d 2001-03-19 --b B+ --a catfur --a pollen --v covax` as a command.

1. The user enters the command in the `UI component`
2. It will be passed to the `Logic component`
3. When `AddCommandParser` receives the information from `PatientParser`, it will invoke the following methods to help with the parsing.
    1. `ParserUtil#parseName` will be called to create a Name object using "John Doe".
    2. `ParserUtil#parsePhone` will be called to create a Phone object using "98765432".
    3. `ParserUtil#parseDob` will be called to create a Dob object using "2001-03-19".
    4. `ParserUtil#parseBloodType` will be called to create a BloodType object using "B+".
    5. `ParserUtil#parseGroups` will be called to create GroupName[] object named allergies using ["catfur", "pollen"].
    6. `ParserUtil#parseGroups` will be called to create GroupName[] object named vaccines using ["covax"].
4. After successfully parsing the args, `AddCommandParser` will create a Patient using the new Name, Phone, Dob, BloodType, Allergies<GroupName>, Vaccines<GroupName>. Then it will create an `AddCommand` with the new Patient object.
5. When `AddCommand#execute` is called, `model#addPatient` will be called to add the new Patient into the model. `AddCommand` will then return `CommandMessage` to indicate it's success.

Note that `Allergies` and `Vaccines` are optional, so the user does not need to include `--a ` or `--v` if the it is not applicable.

The activity diagram below illustrates the workflow of patient `AddCommand` that is described above.

<img src="images/patient/AddPatientActivityDiagram.png" width="550" />

Given below is an sequence diagram that illustrates the **Adding a Patient** mechanism behaves at every step.

<img src="images/patient/AddPatientSequenceDiagram.png" width="550" />

### Listing Patients

The **Listing Patients** mechanism is facilitated by `VMS`. It will list all the Patients that are stored in the `PatientManager`.

##### Execution Sequence

Given below is an example usage scenario when a user enter `patient list` as a command.

1. The user enters the command in the `UI component`
2. It will be passed to the `Logic component`
3. `PatientParser` will invoke `ListCommand` directly without intemediary parser commands as `ListCommand` does not accept any argument.
4. When `ListCommand#execute` is called, `model#updateFilteredPatientList` will be called to update the list with the `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PATIENTS` to display all Patients.

The activity diagram below illustrates the workflow of patient `ListCommand` that is described above.

<img src="images/patient/ListPatientsActivityDiagram.png" width="550" />

Given below is an sequence diagram that illustrates the **Listing Patients** mechanism behaves at every step.

<img src="images/patient/ListPatientsSequenceDiagram.png" width="550" />

### Finding a Patient

The **Finding a Patient** mechanism is facilitated by `VMS`. It will find specific list of Patient objects from `PatientManager` inside `VMS` object with the keywords provided.

The user can choose to add flags when searching, to search for the specific attributes of a Patient. If no flags are present, the mechanism will assume that it is searching the Patient's name.

##### Execution Sequence

Given below is an example usage scenario when a user enter `patient find --n John Doee --p 98765431 --d 2001-03-19 --b B+ --a catfur --v covax` as a command.

1. The user enters the command in the `UI component`
2. It will be passed to the `Logic component`
3. When `FindCommandParser` receives the information from `PatientParser`, it will invoke the following methods to help with the parsing. It will throw a `ParseExeception` if there are no args present.
    1. `ParserUtil#parseName` will be called to create a Name object using "John Doe".
    2. `ParserUtil#parsePhone` will be called to create a Phone object using "98765432".
    3. `ParserUtil#parseDob` will be called to create a Dob object using "2001-03-19".
    4. `ParserUtil#parseBloodType` will be called to create a BloodType object using "B+".
    5. `ParserUtil#parseGroups` will be called to create GroupName[] object named allergies using ["catfur", "pollen"].
    6. `ParserUtil#parseGroups` will be called to create GroupName[] object named vaccines using ["covax"].
4. After successfully parsing the args, the following will happen
    1. `FindCommandParser` will create an FindPatientDescriptor using the new Name, PhoNameContainsKeywordsPredicatene, Dob, BloodType, Allergies `<GroupName>`, Vaccines `<GroupName>`.
    1a. If none of the flags are present, it will take the entire arg as a `setNameSearch`.
    2. Then it will create an `FindCommand` with the new FindPatientDescriptor object.
5. When `FindCommand#execute` is called, the following will happen.
    1. It will check if the different attributes of FindPatientDescriptor is present.
    2. It will find the patient by creating different `Optional<AttributePredicate>`.
    3. The different predicates will be added into a `List<Predicate<Patient>>` and passed to `model#setPatientFilters` to display the filtered Patients.
    4. `FindCommand` will then return `CommandMessage` to indicate it's success and the number of patients found.

The activity diagram below illustrates the workflow of patient `FindCommand` that is described above.

<img src="images/patient/FindPatientActivityDiagram.png" width="550" />

Given below is an sequence diagram that illustrates the **Finding a Patient** mechanism behaves at every step.

<img src="images/patient/FindPatientSequenceDiagram.png" width="550" />

`FindCommandParser#parse` will call `String#trim` to trim the search request. If there is no additional flags, it will fall back to the default of using the search term to find Names.

### Editing a Patient

The **Editing a Patient** mechanism is facilitated by `VMS`. It will read and modify a target Patient object from `PatientManger` inside `VMS` object.

##### Execution Sequence

Given below is an example usage scenario when a user enter `patient edit 5 --n John Doee --p 98765431 --d 2001-03-19 --b B+ --a catfur --a pollen --v covax` as a command.

1. The user enters the command in the `UI component`
2. It will be passed to the `Logic component`
3. When `EditCommandParser` receives the information from `PatientParser`, it will invoke the following methods to help with the parsing. It will short circuit and throw a `ParseExeception` if 1. is not fulfilled.
    1. `ParserUtil#parseIndex` will be called to create a Index object using "5".
    2. `ParserUtil#parseName` will be called to create a Name object using "John Doe".
    3. `ParserUtil#parsePhone` will be called to create a Phone object using "98765432".
    4. `ParserUtil#parseDob` will be called to create a Dob object using "2001-03-19".
    5. `ParserUtil#parseBloodType` will be called to create a BloodType object using "B+".
    6. `ParserUtil#parseGroups` will be called to create GroupName[] object named allergies using ["catfur", "pollen"].
    7. `ParserUtil#parseGroups` will be called to create GroupName[] object named vaccines using ["covax"].
4. After successfully parsing the args, `EditCommandParser` will create an editPatientDescriptor using the new Name, Phone, Dob, BloodType, Allergies `<GroupName>`, Vaccines `<GroupName>`. Then it will create an `EditCommand` with the new editPatientDescriptor object with the index.
5. When `EditCommand#execute` is called, the following will happen.
    1. It will ensure that the Index given is within the list, else it will throw a CommandExeception
    2. It will edit the patient by creating a new patient with the new values from the Parser as Patients are Immuttable
    3. Then `model#setPatient` will be called to add the new Patient into the model.
    4. `EditCommand` will then return `CommandMessage` to indicate it's success.

The activity diagram below illustrates the workflow of patient `EditCommand` that is described above.

<img src="images/patient/EditPatientActivityDiagram.png" width="550" />

Given below is an example usage scenario and how **Editing a Patient** mechanism behaves at each step.

<img src="images/patient/EditPatientSequenceDiagram.png" width="550" />

### Deleting a Patient

The **Deleting a Patients** mechanism is facilitated by `VMS`. It will delete specific Patient objects from `PatientManager` inside `VMS` object with using the index provided.

##### Execution Sequence

Given below is an example usage scenario when a user enter `patient delete 5` as a command.

<!-- TODO -->

<img src="images/patient/DeletePatientActivityDiagram.png" width="550" />
<img src="images/patient/DeletePatientSequenceDiagram.png" width="550" />

### Clearing Patients

The **Clearing Patients** mechanism is facilitated by `VMS`. It will set the patient manager with a new empty patient manager, effectively clearing all the Patients

##### Execution Sequence

Given below is an example usage scenario when a user enter `patient clear` as a command.

1. The user enters the command in the `UI component`
2. It will be passed to the `Logic component`
3. `PatientParser` will invoke `ClearCommand` directly without intemediary parser commands as `ClearCommand` does not accept any argument.
4. When `ClearCommand#execute` is called, `model#setPatientManager` will be called to update the list a new PatientManger() with no patients.

The activity diagram below illustrates the workflow of patient `ClearCommand` that is described above.

<img src="images/patient/ClearPatientActivityDiagram.png" width="550" />

Given below is an sequence diagram that illustrates the **Clearing Patients** mechanism behaves at every step.

<img src="images/patient/ClearPatientSequenceDiagram.png" width="550" />

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedVms`. It extends `Vms` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `patientManagerStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedVms#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current patient manager state in its history.
* `VersionedVms#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous patient manager state from its history.
* `VersionedVms#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone patient manager state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitVms()`, `Model#undoVms()` and `Model#redoVms()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedVms` will be initialized with the initial patient manager state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single patient manager state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th patient in the patient manager. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitVms()`, causing the modified state of the patient manager after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `patientManagerStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted patient manager state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new patient. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitVms()`, causing another modified patient manager state to be saved into the `patientManagerStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitVms()`, so the patient manager state will not be saved into the `patientManagerStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the patient was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoVms()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous patient manager state, and restores the patient manager to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial Vms state, then there are no previous Vms states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoVms()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoVms()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the patient manager to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `patientManagerStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest patient manager state, then there are no undone Vms states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoVms()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the patient manager, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitVms()`, `Model#undoVms()` or `Model#redoVms()`. Thus, the `patientManagerStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitVms()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `patientManagerStateList`, all patient manager states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire patient manager.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the patient being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
