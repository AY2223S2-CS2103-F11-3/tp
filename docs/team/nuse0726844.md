### Project: VaccinationManagementSystem

The Vaccination Management System (VMS) is a Java desktop application used for **managing and keeping track of vaccination appointments**.
VMS is **optimised for users that can type fast and prefer Command Line Interface (CLI)**.
VMS has both CLI, for users to input commands, and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX, that is used primarily to give visual feedback to the user.

Just the headings are enough. You can write to be added soon as placeholders for content.
